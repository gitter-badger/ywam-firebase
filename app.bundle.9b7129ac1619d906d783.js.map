We will make one final copy from the SQL database and discontinue the old site or configure it to also use only the new database.  \\n<br><br>\\nAt first this site will have to be very very very simple, just the basics. I would rather have a few site features working fully, than to have many features that are half working.  \\n<br><br>\\nTim Scholten - tim.scholten@ywamsarasota.com\\n\\n<br>\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/timtimmytime/ywam-staff-webapp-firebase/issues\\\"> Report issues here </a>\\n</p>\\n<br>\\n\\n<!--<table class=\\\"ftable\\\"   >\\n<thead>\\n  <tr>\\n    <th>Feature</th><th>Status</th>\\n  </tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tr><td ui-sref=\\\"schools\\\"> List of Schools</td><td class=\\\"works\\\">Works!</td></tr>\\n<tr><td ui-sref=\\\"school.studentList({school_id:42})\\\"> Student List</td><td>In Progress</td></tr>\\n<tr><td ui-sref=\\\"school.application({school_id:86,app_id:'mB9H1NoELsUq37yZ78nhidDeaDc2_school_86'})\\\"> Student Application View</td><td>In Progress</td></tr>\\n<tr><td ui-sref=\\\"school.staff({school_id:42})\\\"> School Staff List</td><td>In Progress</td></tr>\\n<tr><td ui-sref=\\\"school.settings({school_id:42})\\\"> School Settings</td><td class=\\\"works\\\">Works!</td></tr>\\n<tr><td ui-sref=\\\"translation\\\">Translation</td><td class=\\\"works\\\">Works!</td></tr>\\n<tr><td>Google Sign in</td><td class=\\\"works\\\">Works </td></tr>\\n<tr><td>Facebook Sign in</td><td class=\\\"works\\\">Works </td></tr>\\n<tr><td>Email/pass Sign in</td><td class=\\\"works\\\">Works!</td></tr>\\n<tr><td>Search</td><td>In Progress</td></tr>\\n<tr><td>Staff:Current</td><td class=\\\"works\\\">Works</td></tr>\\n<tr><td>Staff:Alumni</td><td class=\\\"works\\\">Works</td></tr>\\n<tr><td>Staff:Applications List</td><td>Works</td></tr>\\n\\n</table>  -->\\n\\n<br>\\nFew Goals:\\n<ul>\\n  <li>it loads fast!</li>\\n  <li>make it look good on mobile</li>\\n  <li>build it in a way that it works for any ywam base</li>\\n</ul>\\n<br>\\n\\n</p>  \\n<!--</div>-->\\n   <!--<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U5aeM5dvUpA\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>-->\\n\\n      </md-card-content>\\n    </md-card>\\n  </div>\\n</div >\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 398 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _classCallCheck2 = __webpack_require__(328);\n\t\n\tvar _classCallCheck3 = _interopRequireDefault(_classCallCheck2);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?

Firebase which has many benefits. \\nMainly that it is very fast, and enables realtime data to all connected devices, no more refreshing to see the latest information! \\nThis means that I have to migrate all data from the old SQL database to this new one, all data that you see on this site is just a copy of the SQL database that login.mission-live.com is working from. \\nOnce this site it built up enough that all essential tasks can be accomplished here, then the database this site is connected to will become the main one. We will make one final copy from the SQL database and discontinue the old site or configure it to also use only the new database.  \\n<br><br>\\nAt first this site will have to be very very very simple, just the basics. I would rather have a few site features working fully, than to have many features that are half working.  \\n<br><br>\\nTim Scholten - tim.scholten@ywamsarasota.com\\n\\n<br>\\n<a
