We will make one final copy from the SQL database and discontinue the old site or configure it to also use only the new database.  \\n<br><br>\\nAt first this site will have to be very very very simple, just the basics.

We will make one final copy from the SQL database and discontinue the old site or configure it to also use only the new database.  \\n<br><br>\\nAt first this site will have to be very very very simple, just the basics.
